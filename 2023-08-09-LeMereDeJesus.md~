For mother Mary, she is the mother of Jesus.
You with her cut the water.
You with her in the mountain.
You with her a la mere de Jesus.

Mere De Le Jesus
Wifu De Buddha.

Many thanks mother.
Many thanks mere de Jesus.
For Mary, how are you?

For mother Mary, she is the mother of Jesus.
You with her cut the water.
You with her in the mountain.
Vou with her on the guillotine.

Mere De Le Jesus
Wifu De Buddha.

Many thanks mother.
Many thanks mere de Jesus.
For Mary, how are you?

With one bougie for death.
For mother Mary, she is the mother of Jesus.
