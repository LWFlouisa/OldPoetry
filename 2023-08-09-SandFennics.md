To think that I see gold<br />
Where there is only dust.<br />
In this world of rust.<br />
The dust so strong and windy<br />
Across the midnight evening.

I wander the sand.<br />
I seek and demand<br />
Water.<br />
Through the hot sand<br />
I cover my hat<br />
Tilting.<br />
And beyond dunes<br />
With land runes<br />
Hiding...

The wild sand fennics<br />
Scrounge for the bugs<br />
Crawling in the sand.<br />
Hungry, they seek bugs<br />
For all of life.
