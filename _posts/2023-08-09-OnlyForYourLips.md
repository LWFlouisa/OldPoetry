<i>A darker take on 1950s pop songs.</i>

Only for your lips.<br />
Only for your lips<br />
Shall I long for the blood.<br />
Only for your lips.<br />
Je veux le rouge tete.

( Je veux le rouge tete<br />
Bonne nuit, kuchiburu. )

With this trot at midnight,<br />
moon shall our parting.<br />
With this trot at midnight<br />
at the darkest hour I<br />
embrace you as we

Make farewell kisses<br />
in pool a blood.

We didn't want to part,<br />
for our love couldn't start.<br />
The accordion under the moonlight hour,<br />
marked her execution.

( Je veux le rouge tete<br />
Bonne nuit, kuchiburu. )

Only for your lips.<br />
Only for your lips<br />
Shall I long for the blood.<br />
Only for your lips.<br />
Je veux le rouge tete.

Even in death, shall we never part,<br />
The couple of death has their embrace.

As I carass your beautiful face.<br />
The severed head of a goose girl.<br />
My farest dove in flight.
