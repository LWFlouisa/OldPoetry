I hang around<br />
your shoulders and kiss.<br />
And by night I hiss.

The moonlight shines<br />
overhead, its divine...<br />
a crow is perched.

I stare into<br />
your nightly gaze for me<br />
to embrace the prick.

Like a razor<br />
blade, it tingles my neck...<br />
the blade strikes.

My neck into yours<br />
in this deathly embrace...<br />
for him we grace.

And tap dance up<br />
The heavenly staircase.
