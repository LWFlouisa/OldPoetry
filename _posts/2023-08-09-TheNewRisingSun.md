The French came far sooner<br />
than army from Rising sun.<br />
All the trumpets blared<br />
so loud, my ears flared<br />
in my pain.

The first fed us only wheat,<br />
Rising Sun gave no<br />
rice for us all as well.<br />
The first fed us only wheat,<br />
we stockpiled.

We took our guns from our<br />
family home, the<br />
Rising Sun fought to<br />
every last man in line.<br />
We fought hard

For the right to be nations<br />
strong and proud, rice<br />
for all to share.<br />
For the right to be nations.<br />
Our rising.

Not as Rising Sun, who<br />
we fought to the last.
