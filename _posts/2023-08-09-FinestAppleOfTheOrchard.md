VERSE<br />
My girlfriend is<br />
as sweet as cherry pie.<br />
With bunny ears.

Pour cette pomme je veux<br />
Un beze. Mie wifu du sange.

My girlfriend is<br />
as sweet as cherry pie.<br />
With bunny ears.

CHORUS<br />
Not all is at it seems,<br />
in the world of in between.<br />
With reality tearing at the seams.<br />
Demons shaped shaped like pyramids with eyes of hades.

VERSE<br />
Come to my my sweet apple,<br />
Finest fruit of the orchard.<br />
Finest cherry in a fruit pie.

My girlfriend is<br />
as sweet as cherry pie.

When she's not acting like a demon,<br />
That wants to eat my soul.

CHORUS<br />
Not all is at it seems,<br />
in the world of in between.<br />
With reality tearing at the seams.<br />
Demons shaped shaped like pyramids with eyes of hades.

VERSE<br />
But only you in wooden shoes,<br />
And your bunny ears, with your pet goose,<br />
Can put those demons in a noose.

My girlfriend is<br />
as sweet as cherry pie.<br />
With bunny ears.
