In repose I<br />
sit wondering why<br />
sleep<br />
Gives way, in the<br />
dark, flowing free.<br />
Darkness<br />
Beside the bed,<br />
dreams dreaming<br />
in bed.

In repose I<br />
sleep in this coffin<br />
under the Earth.<br />
I rest for all eternity,<br />
I rest for all this time.

Along the midnight forest<br />
I seek blood<br />
from a woman's neck.<br />
Yet the desire fades.<br />
I rest for all this time.

I rest for all this time,<br />
In repose I seek.
