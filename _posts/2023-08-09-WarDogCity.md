In the city, with the river<br />
the water with blood,<br />
from all the resting,<br />
flows out to the ocean;<br />
all that flowing.

Skyline raining down from<br />
above, betrays the<br />
city stench, flowing free.<br />
With Neon lights all above<br />
the tall peaks.

Where once was the fishes<br />
Underneath clouds,<br />
Rain comes in from<br />
the Eastern winds hard blowing,<br />
free flowing.

A lonely song, for lonely<br />
time, decaying<br />
with the rusted metal<br />
of scattered war dog debris,<br />
debris resting...

For some chosen wielder<br />
with the right touch.
