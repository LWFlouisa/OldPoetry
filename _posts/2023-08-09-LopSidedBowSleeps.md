Lopsided bow red<br />
and frilly, tilted<br />
leftward.<br />
Her shirt the color<br />
of the sunset sky.<br />
Shadows<br />
in the crypt lurking,<br />
seeking. They who<br />
haunt

the winter sunset<br />
make their bets sitting<br />
down, long in the crypt.

Midnight she sleeps<br />
Her power now beckons me<br />
to the darkest night.
