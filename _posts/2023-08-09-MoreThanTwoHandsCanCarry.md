When it all becomes Gospel,<br />
violating body<br />
as the only chapel,<br />
only the good now dying<br />
are young.

When it all becomes Gospel,<br />
with so many holes<br />
more than two hands<br />
can carry, one dies to<br />
young tonight.

As the piano plays its tune,<br />
lonely melody,<br />
the clock strikes midnight<br />
when it all becomes Gospel<br />
on chilly nights.

When it all becomes Gospel<br />
the blood drains from<br />
the many holes in<br />
my body, in lonely song<br />
on chilly nights.

Come chilly winter mid nights,<br />
Give me the midnight sonnet.<br />
For this song more then two hands<br />
can carry.

For those who seek to vilify,<br />
care not your intentions,<br />
but for your taste in blood.
