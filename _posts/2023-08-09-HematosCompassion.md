It is my compassion<br />
why I lick blood swiftly.<br />
it is my compassion<br />
that I hold severed head of<br />
Ehena, my goose

Girl, my princess of murder.<br />
It is my compassion<br />
that I put her down.

Panic attacks are swift<br />
in this town of always<br />
like the blade of guillotines.<br />
Down the goose that pecks out eyes.<br />
Dont with the father, whom only lies to me.

It is my compassion<br />
why I lick blood swiftly.<br />
it is my compassion<br />
that I hold severed head of<br />
Ehena, my goose.

Girl, my princess of murder.<br />
It is my compassion<br />
that I put her down.

And yet it was this love,<br />
in the kingdom of broken geese,<br />
for this angel whom I knew,<br />
in this Kingdom by the sea.

With a trust in me, and me not her,<br />
As I jingle my spurs, with crossbow in tow.
