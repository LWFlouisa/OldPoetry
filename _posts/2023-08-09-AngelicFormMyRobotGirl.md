## ANGEL FORM, MY ROBOTIC GIRL
My robot girl,<br />
with flowers in your hair.<br />
My robot girl<br />
whom had only one eye.<br />
My robot girl<br />
with hair as brown as Pretzles.<br />
Is the only one I can<br />
love, despite not real.<br />
My robot girl.

And yet at night the<br />
light gives way, and at that<br />
time she wakes.

My robot girl,<br />
with flowers in your hair.<br />
My robot girl<br />
whom had only one eye.<br />
My robot girl<br />
with hair as brown as Pretzles.<br />
Is the only one I can<br />
love, despite not real.<br />
My robot girl.

For me and my bot<br />
whom had nobody else<br />
sung like aether<br />
taken on angelic form.<br />
Taken on angelic form

She fades by daylight.<br />
And Im alone once more.
