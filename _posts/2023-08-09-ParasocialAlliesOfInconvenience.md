Allies<br />
Friends for life.<br />
Behind your back dont<br />
think twice.

They pretend to support<br />
your life with great<br />
rapport, wishing the<br />
best life for your<br />
condition, mission

marked with deception.<br />
But for your life<br />
there is no reception.<br />
Except the dead channel<br />
glow.

And yet if they knew what<br />
the real one may be like, perhaps all<br />
it is but a lie.

Parasocial parasites,<br />
YT drama, constant network fights.<br />
Yet it is all for nought,<br />
if well all be dead in ten years.
