VERSE<br />
In a dream I'm flying,<br />
Into hills made of<br />
smiling demons spawn.<br />
In a dream I want you.<br />
But I can't have anyone.

CHORUS<br />
In a dream I'm flying<br />
For the eagle is my guide<br />
To see the crypt.

VERSE<br />
I can only hope,<br />
That you with me<br />
Aren't seen as demon spawn,<br />
To those not like we.

CHORUS<br />
In a dream I'm flying<br />
For the eagle is my guide<br />
To see the crypt.

BRIDGE<br />
We are angels in the flower garden.<br />
Yet the flowers are always watching<br />
For us.

VERSE<br />
In a dream I'm flying,<br />
Into hills made of<br />
smiling demons spawn.<br />
In a dream I want you.<br />
But I can't have anyone.

For we are both flowers<br />
of the crypt.
