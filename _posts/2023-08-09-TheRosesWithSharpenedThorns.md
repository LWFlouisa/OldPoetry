Between us and the roses with<br />
all the sharpened thorns,<br />
the plants sway in garden<br />
all back and forth, in the garden<br />
of the midnight.

The river flows around the bend,<br />
flowing in the forest<br />
that flows in breeze.<br />
The deer munching in the forest<br />
eats the bushes

flowing in the breeze,<br />
along the river bend.
