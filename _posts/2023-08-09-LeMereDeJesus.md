For mother Mary, she is the mother of Jesus.<br />
You with her cut the water.<br />
You with her in the mountain.<br />
You with her a la mere de Jesus.

Mere De Le Jesus<br />
Wifu De Buddha.

Many thanks mother.<br />
Many thanks mere de Jesus.<br />
For Mary, how are you?

For mother Mary, she is the mother of Jesus.<br />
You with her cut the water.<br />
You with her in the mountain.<br />
Vou with her on the guillotine.

Mere De Le Jesus<br />
Wifu De Buddha.

Many thanks mother.<br />
Many thanks mere de Jesus.<br />
For Mary, how are you?

With one bougie for death.<br />
For mother Mary, she is the mother of Jesus.
