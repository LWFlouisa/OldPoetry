Nightmare reigns.<br />
The shadows along the wall jeer.<br />
Nightmare reigns,<br />
from dusk till the emerging dawn.<br />
Nightmare reigns,<br />
the early clouds are foggy<br />
as the light bleeds through the darkness<br />
that tormented me in my sleep.<br />
Nightmare reigns.

In my head I<br />
dream of fairy kingdoms snowy...<br />
purple lake boils.

Voreth's Promise<br />
created by the elder wizard.<br />
Voreth's Promise<br />
to rid the world of disease.<br />
Voreth's Promise,<br />
the seer of great widsom<br />
with is carved walking stick,<br />
whom died for us all on that day.<br />
Voreth's Promise.

The evil knight wants<br />
the princess wants him not...<br />
an ax was falling.<br />
World is boiling.<br />
Malady is getting worse.<br />
World is boiling,<br />
and plague is a lurking ghost.<br />
World is boiling,<br />
and contangion spread is flaming<br />
from the hell to big cities.<br />
World is boiling.

Yet one hesitates.<br />
It is not yet time.<br />
To seek assistance.

From outside the game.
