## CHRISTMAS VAMPIRE
With her white dress<br />
She dangled down the chimney.<br />
With her white dress,<br />
She dangled on noose.<br />
She dangled on noose.<br />
The cold season<br />
brings chocolate<br />
Treats, and presents<br />
Through the whole year.<br />
Through the whole year.

The Chistmas Vampire hung<br />
On London bridge, and left<br />
Two children. Paupers<br />
Without a seasons bring.<br />
The Christmas Vampire hung,<br />
On London bridge.

One became a banker,<br />
The other a CEO.<br />
The eldest was a wanker,<br />
While the other watched space movies,<br />
On an old terminal,

And thumb their noses at paupers,<br />
Without a seasons bring.
