Izu mihi zumi,<br />
Izu mihi zumi<br />
izu mihi zu.<br />
Izu mihi zumi,<br />
Izu mihi zumi.

In my dreams I think<br />
of nightmares, razors<br />
along the spine.<br />
In my dreams I think:<br />
blood like wine.<br />
In my dreams I remember all the pain.<br />
From razor blades with the beveled tines.

Blood flows like the<br />
spout from a lave,<br />
spewing out as<br />
if it were merely<br />
lava in a mountain.<br />
In my dreams I remember all the pain.<br />
From razor blades with the beveled tines.
