She waits for her<br />
Her lover from afar.<br />
Someday they all hold hands.

Out the window into night.<br />
Out the window into night,

Those eyes glow.<br />
Those eyes glow<br />
Missing their lover afar.<br />
Out the window into night,<br />
She waits for her.

On a horse the<br />
Sunset overhead<br />
Looms over the skyline.

Out the window into night.<br />
Out the window into night,
