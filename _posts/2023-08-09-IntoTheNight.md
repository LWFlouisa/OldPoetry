To think I see wind,<br />
In these catacombs deep.<br />
In these catacombs I choose to tonight sleep.<br />
In these catacombs deep.

I wait for the monsters within,<br />
As they come a wanting for my tiny neck.<br />
To see all my hair come down falling on the floor.<br />
Now they come a wanting for my tiny neck.

To think I see wind,<br />
In these catacombs deep.<br />
In these catacombs I choose to tonight sleep.<br />
In these catacombs deep.

Those beasts within bite down,<br />
Lusting after my tiny neck.
