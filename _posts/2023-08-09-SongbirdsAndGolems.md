At midnight, the songbirds call.<br />
The golemns sing of the fall.<br />
To think that rome could so quickly fall.

Mechanations<br />
Dangling from the sky at night.<br />
Mechanations.

On this road, knowing not where to go.<br />
The roadway is covered with snow.

Unlike in Rome,<br />
where Hannibal slays God.<br />
The city remains to rot.

It rots all eternal midnight long.
