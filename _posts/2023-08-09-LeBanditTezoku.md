The man in black is<br />
here to stay, inside<br />
weak wilting minds.<br />
Here to stay, inside<br />
the desert burial tomb.

Inside the crypt he<br />
waits in shadows lurking.<br />
Inside the crypt, he<br />
wait to kill the Goddess<br />
of cold wilting Pyramid.

The man in black is<br />
here to stay, inside<br />
weak wilting minds.<br />
Here to stay, inside<br />
the desert burial tomb.

Beyond the door<br />
waiting, with a gun he<br />
pounces and strikes.<br />
And drinks of Goddess blood.<br />
He drinks of Goddess blood.

All the moonlight hour.
