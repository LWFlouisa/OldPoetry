Like pianos / sitting by window,<br />
life is a mix of highs / and lows near the flower<br />
garden, Lotuses / and daisies.

Under moonlight / in Winter Forest<br />
the flowers wilt as Summer / fades to memories.<br />
In world without / a sun to light the

forest, the Winter / chill is the only<br />
melody for which may / seek solace with death.<br />
And soon, midnight / comes to reap, for

we are only dust.
