### LADY IN WHITE

Girl in white<br />
with daisies in her light brown hair.<br />
Girl in white<br />
with flowers scattered falling down.<br />
Girl in white<br />
who represents no woman that<br />
lives on Earth or in Heaven<br />
above, to sweet for both.<br />
Girl in white.

The rain pours down<br />
for me and you tonight, dear<br />
Girl in white. That

Lives in dreams.<br />

Girl in white<br />
with daisies in her light brown hair.<br />
Girl in white<br />
with flowers scattered falling down.<br />
Girl in white<br />
who represents no woman that<br />
lives on Earth or in Heaven<br />
above, to sweet for both.<br />
Girl in white.

It was years that<br />
a blade took my world from<br />
me, lady dreams.

To think that all I have<br />
Is memories of<br />
my darling lady<br />
In white that haunts me<br />
in my dreams. Fateful

Day.

The rain pours down<br />
for me and you tonight, dear<br />
Girl in white.
