Old book shop glows.<br />
The hallways gently beckon you.<br />
Old book shop glows.<br />
The shadows along wall beckon<br />
you to join them by the chimney.<br />
The flames are now hopping.<br />
Old book shop glows.

And wooden shoes by<br />
the fireplace sit for<br />
feet to wear them.

Old book shop glows.<br />
The hallways gently beckon you.<br />
Old book shop glows.<br />
The shadows along wall beckon<br />
you to join them by the chimney.<br />
The flames are now hopping.<br />
Old book shop glows.

The smell of evergreen fills the room with flavored smoke.<br />
Bookshelves that fill the room give many to tell.<br />
Lets hope one picks the right one or you'll go to hell.
