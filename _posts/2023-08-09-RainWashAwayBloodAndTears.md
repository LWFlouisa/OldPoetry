Hifi mihi.<br />
Hifu mihi fumi hifu.<br />

Wabi sabi.<br />
Beauty in the imperfection.<br />
Wabi sabi.<br />
Like morning rain with yellow red.<br />
The rain clouds rise overhead<br />
and drench the crimson raincoats.<br />
Wabi sabi.

La vie in rose.<br />
With all its tragic flaws...<br />
Midnight comes soon.

CHORUS<br />
Dont forget to live<br />
with all lifes quirks,<br />
the rain roses grass.

With crimson raincoats<br />
it covers up the blood<br />
and sops up the rain.

Wabi sabi.<br />
Beauty in the imperfection.<br />
Wabi sabi.<br />
Like morning rain with yellow red.<br />
The rain clouds rise overhead<br />
and drench the crimson raincoats.<br />
Wabi sabi.

CHORUS<br />
Perhaps the rain will<br />
wash away the blood and tears.
