The hillsides under sunset<br />
Glow in the sunlight till moonlight comes.<br />
In the hillside under sunset<br />
The trees sway back<br />
And forth in the wind, till moonlight.<br />
The hillsides under sunset.

Under dark moonlight skies<br />
The owls of the forest hide in trees.<br />
Under the dark moonlight skies.<br />
They seek food and water.<br />
For water and food they want.<br />
They seek food and water.

The tower in the distance<br />
Calls the wind and the water at day.<br />
The old tower in the distance<br />
Seeks the quiet warm day.<br />
As the day becomes colder,<br />
The city becomes a ghost town.

The city becomes a ghost town,<br />
And no voice is stirring.
