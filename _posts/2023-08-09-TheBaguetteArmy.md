They came for the<br />
women and children in storm,<br />
Marching on road.<br />
The unit then rolled forth.<br />
The unit then rolled forth.

Down the old chimney<br />
Was the smokes in the lungs<br />
Blowing in the wind.<br />
The unit came rolling.<br />
The unit came rolling.

Down the old highway<br />
They came rolling along<br />
Marching on road.

The bombs and the war dogs<br />
Came rolling along.
