My girl of rose / with curly black hair,<br />
You are my fair queen / and with me always there.<br />
The moonlight is young / your songbirds hum sung.

Between me / and the starlight<br />
there is the world to see / with fields of green and yellow.<br />
Between me / and the starlight<br />
there is nothing I cant for you / even if it destroys our life.<br />
The fields of glory a fragile / as the missles come falling.<br />
There is nothing I cant for you / even if it destroys our life.

My girl of rose / with curly black hair,<br />
You are my fair queen / and with me always there.<br />
The moonlight is young / your songbirds hum sung.

With your hair / like ebony.<br />
Our lives are never far apart.
