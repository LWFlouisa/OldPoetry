Why is Jpop better about losing life,<br />
While KPop fails to enjoy the loves of its life.<br />
The ladies whom many seek, and call their wife.<br />
To think that the difference between the genres,<br />
Can amount to something stupid or shameful,<br />
Like how to treat your wife. And yet girls love the sound.

Why is JPop more emotive, when a girl loses her life,<br />
Despite the fact Kpop has a darker way of life.<br />
Perhaps it is these lovely things, that make them come to believe.<br />
That theyre only robots, and not worth being wives.<br />
Or to simply enjoy their life, single or not.<br />
JPop can be great again, like KPop on the dance floor.<br />
KPop can find its shining grace, without focosing on so mucn gore.

Why is it JPop and KPop seem so different.<br />
When we have so much in common. If only friends can see.<br />
Perhaps the girls of KPops really believe theyre only robots.

Despite the charities.<br />
Despite all the good they can do.
