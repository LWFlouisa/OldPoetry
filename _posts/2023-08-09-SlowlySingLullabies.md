Bloody hands on floor.
Licking tongue along the gore.
Only those with lust
On the floor, on the floor
Devise ways for more blood.

Hands behind the back
Always one step behind.
Neck and neck with death.
Devise ways for more blood,
Sliding hands on the floor.

Along the floor I lay,
Nocturnal moonlight abyss.
Devise ways for more blood.

Neck and neck with so many ways to go.
Even as the moonlight fades,
Coldly the daylight is no more.
Karry with her cat in a napsack
Slowly sings lullibies once more.
