In the forest night, the midnight starlight<br />
shines above; Winter is chilly.<br />
Ice falling, sky darkens.<br />
Within midnight trees, voice gently calling.<br />
Guillotined girls, tattered robes.<br />
Blood pouring into lakes.<br />
Blood rivers quickly cools.

A shadow in night with a small basket<br />
carries the severed heads of the maidens fallen...<br />
The midnight fades into the morning.<br />
The guillotine blade is rising quickly.<br />
The 100 pounds comes a sudden stop.

In the forest night, the midnight starlight<br />
shines above; Winter is chilly.<br />
Ice falling, sky darkens.<br />
Within midnight trees, voice gently calling.<br />
Guillotined girls, tattered robes.<br />
Blood pouring into lakes.<br />
Blood rivers quickly cools.

Perhaps that's why they say,<br />
dont enter the midnight forest.<br />
For thats where the local headsman lives.
