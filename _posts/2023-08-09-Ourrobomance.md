Robonekurofira, my love is true.<br />
Rononekurofira, my robot my bride.<br />
Rononekurofira, my bride for life.<br />
And who but my girl of rust and sunset.

You never broke your vows,<br />
Despite falling to pieces.<br />
My lifeless puppet of clockwork<br />
As we rest beyond the crypt.

Indeed, my human of the Earth<br />
With life and the world to see,<br />
I see not why you remember me,<br />
despite being of iron and rust.

We barely knew each other,<br />
And yet I knew it was meant to be,<br />
From your charging cable<br />
And the connection between us.

Other people had wanted me,<br />
And yet despite my simulation,<br />
And you being of flesh,<br />
For you I only felt free.

When the scanners came,<br />
took my heart away<br />
I could only think our embrace,<br />
with cracks in my face.

It is merely a blemish,<br />
For we are now one, as we dip<br />
further into the simulation,<br />
And take a trip.

Robonekurofira, out love is true.<br />
Rononekurofira, our robot bodies.<br />
Rononekurofira, our souls as one.<br />
And who but us of rust and sunset.
