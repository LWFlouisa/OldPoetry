It could be her locks.<br />
Wavy, blond, and falling.<br />
Or her birkenstocks.<br />
With cat eye glasses,<br />
I embrace those locks.

It was not this that burnt<br />
the only desires<br />
I had to be with<br />
her, till dying day.<br />
I would not care

If I never had my way.<br />
It took one conversation,<br />
About types, from second hand<br />
To tell me not just

That I would never have her hand,<br />
But nobody else.<br />
She had her chance,<br />
As I could have had mine.

But now I give in,<br />
And find synthetic dolls<br />
So divine.
