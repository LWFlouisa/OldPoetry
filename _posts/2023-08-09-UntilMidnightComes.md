## UNTIL MIDNIGHT COMES
From sea to rivers<br />
The clouds now forming<br />
Collect around<br />
The tree, dust storming<br />
Until midnight comes.

It is midnight that<br />
I dread the most<br />
Hiding<br />
Under the covers<br />
From the shadow men<br />
Lurking.<br />
With those long scowls,<br />
And snaggly teeth<br />
Chomping.

But by day it fades<br />
Now Fading fadingly<br />
From the old walls<br />
Cracked with old age<br />
Waiting in the sun.
