In the midnight forest<br />
where one sings songs<br />
to the zombie that<br />
rules us all, mankind<br />
grant us mercy, for us all.

In midnight castle<br />
where the revenent sings a<br />
battle cry for me.

In the midnight forest<br />
where one sings songs,<br />
princess with her hand<br />
grants powers to us all.<br />
We shall all be a King

to rule secret<br />
Kingdoms by the river<br />
drowning in blood.

In the Queendom of the blood,<br />
grant is freedom from our misery,<br />
and let us rule among the dead,<br />
lady queen of all.
