The old flag rose<br />
That was red, white, and blue.<br />
That old flag rose<br />
In my wooden shoes.<br />
In my wooden shoes<br />
I hold up that flag,<br />
Despite so many flaws.<br />
I hold up that flag<br />

In my wooden shoes.<br />
In my wooden shoes.

She wore a bow<br />
That covered her hair.<br />
She wore a bow.<br />
In her wooden shoes.<br />
In her wooden shoes.<br />
Her hand knit dresses<br />
Are now faded in color.<br />
Her hand knit dresses<br />
In her wooden shoes.<br />
In her wooden shoes.

From the beaches of Normandy<br />,
From the winter of Strasbourg.<br />
And evenings in Tokyo,<br />
The girl of Tokyo and Strasbourg.<br />
In her wooden shoes.
