The sword sharp shines<br />
in the river brine<br />
that is divine,<br />
In the darkest water fall.<br />
its blade shines so bright,<br />
Its blade shines so bright.

In this cold Winter<br />
where the souls rise<br />
The dead rocking<br />
Out of their caskets.<br />
Out of their caskets.

It seeks holder<br />
who may be so much bolder,<br />
yet is much colder<br />
than any slimey merchant fox.<br />
Slicing the leaf.<br />
Slicing the leaf.

In this cold Winter<br />
where the souls rise,<br />
the dead rocking<br />
Out of their caskets,<br />
Out of their caskets

The dead do rise.<br />
The dead do rise.
