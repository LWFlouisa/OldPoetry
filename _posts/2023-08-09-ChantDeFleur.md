## Chant De Fleur
Chains on fence give suspence.<br />
The guillotines are bloody as the dead do pile.<br />
Come and stay with me today.

Chains on fence give suspence,<br />
in courtyard by the fence the dead rot long<br />
all in a pile. All in a pile

Come and stay with me today,<br />
all the roses and petunias dont compare,<br />
to Chrysthamums common and scarce.
