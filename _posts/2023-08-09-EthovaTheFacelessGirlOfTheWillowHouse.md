School day was so quiet<br />
without the students<br />
making sounds today.<br />
Only birds break silence<br />
in the school.

The school bell rang, harmony<br />
reaching the hallway.<br />
Breaking silence,<br />
I lock the doorway behind,<br />
closing gate.

Wind was chilly at the dining,<br />
I treated him to<br />
local delights tonight.<br />
Soon wind stopped the dining,<br />
we left after.

It was my first date that day,<br />
I barely knew him.<br />
But no no was taken,<br />
he wouldn't have it my way<br />
on the train.

At his old family home,<br />
he sat me on couch.<br />
He gave me flowers<br />
while I rested on edge<br />
of my seat.

Months came and went lightning fast,<br />
so many months and<br />
no more words from him,<br />
was always working basement<br />
at all hours.

At night I would get odd calls<br />
in cellphone case.<br />
It was not him though,<br />
but the girl without face<br />
in the shadows.

If you think I may be not<br />
telling you the truth,<br />
come and sit with me,<br />
as a tell you a story<br />
in my booth.

At times I hear sounds<br />
from in his basement,<br />
anguished cries<br />
from only god knows now where.<br />
Yet I can't go.

The normal path is now locked,<br />
in basement I know<br />
not, for what lies in<br />
side those dark catacombs<br />
of silence.

Inside the basement I<br />
look from all rooms,<br />
hearing odd cries.<br />
Behind me was the faceless:<br />
"Go now Ako!"

The door was unlocked in<br />
basement waiting<br />
for my own escape.<br />
My husband knocked in kitchen,<br />
to find myself.

Ako with the metal bat told<br />
me to run and hide.<br />
I ran to willow tree<br />
wanting to protect my hide<br />
from my hubby.

In the distance, I heard<br />
the sound of metal<br />
bats, whacking across<br />
and breaking all the bones<br />
in all his limbs.

Carefully, I called the<br />
cops. Ako guided<br />
my path from this town.<br />
This town I called my home.<br />
I do thank her.

On the news I heard he went,<br />
from lots of blunt strokes.<br />
I couldn't help but think<br />
Ako was both to blame and<br />
to helped me...

Secure my escape.<br />
Her face affixed with malicious grin<br />
on the security camera,<br />
as the prison footage went to static.

The ghost of the willow house.
