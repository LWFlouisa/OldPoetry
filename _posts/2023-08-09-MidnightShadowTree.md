I ride a horse<br />
into the falling sunset.<br />
Midnight is coming.

I ride a black horse<br />
With my rifle in tow,<br />
A girl with a bow<br />
lopsided, also sits<br />
behind me, holding on<br />
As the bow slides off.

As shadows lurking<br />
In the dark midnight forest,<br />
The wolves now howl.

The wolf with its baying<br />
Now seeks comfort<br />
Under a burned tree,<br />
Swaying slowly in<br />
The gently blowing<br />
wind. Morning comes knocking<br />
Under the burned tree.

As shadows lurking<br />
In the dark midnight forest,<br />
The wolves howled.

The shadows now fade away.<br />
The shadows burn away,<br />
Under a morning sun.
