For all this talk<br />
of tolerance of the strange.<br />
For all this talk<br />
they play dice, cowboys, bandits.<br />
For all this talk<br />
with all their sweet they wilt<br />
under pressure from out there<br />
hiding pain deep within them.<br />
For all this talk

they never leave<br />
their comfort zone, the life<br />
like movie sets.

For all this talk<br />
of tolerance of the strange.<br />
For all this talk<br />
they play dice, cowboys, bandits.<br />
For all this talk<br />
with all their sweet they wilt<br />
under pressure from out there<br />
hiding pain deep within them.<br />
For all this talk

Youd think theyd solve<br />
their own industry issues,<br />
and yet dreamless.

From Tokyo to Paris<br />
and Seoul, Bangkok<br />
And boats<br />
Youll never sea friends<br />
as proper allies<br />
in bed<br />
Or anywhere in between.<br />
For this land is for<br />
fast food.

For all this talk<br />
they play dice, cowboys, bandits.<br />
For all this talk<br />
with all their sweet they wilt<br />
under pressure from out there<br />
hiding pain deep within them.<br />
For all this talk

Youd think theyd talk a walk<br />
touch some grass.<br />
Its not as if acts<br />
were all they ever knew.
