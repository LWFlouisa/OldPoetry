Locked Bleachers<br />
in a broken down high school.<br />
Locked Bleachers<br />
covered in blood on floor.<br />
Severed heads of students<br />
fill the bleachers in seats.<br />
Locked Bleachers.

To think that all they<br />
did was upset the Dean<br />
with his odd brow.

Broken angels<br />
with armor like golden dress.<br />
Broken angels<br />
with their firm caress, murder<br />
the toxic dean with crossbow.<br />
And hung his body on hoops.<br />
Broken angels.

All the dead come<br />
back as tall zombies<br />
with head sewn on.<br />
All the dead girls with<br />
their armored dress<br />
and Birkenstocks.

And mangle the Dean further.<br />

Locked Bleachers<br />
in a broken down high school.<br />
Locked Bleachers<br />
covered in blood on floor.<br />
Severed heads of students<br />
fill the bleachers in seats.<br />
Locked Bleachers.

But at this schoolyard,<br />
the broken angels teach themselves.
