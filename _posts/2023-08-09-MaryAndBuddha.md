Midnight comes and<br />
blows away like the wind...<br />
cold raindrops spatter.

Mother Mary<br />
mother of Jesus holds babies.<br />
Mother Mary<br />
strewn pieces of her affection.<br />
With Buddha shall rise again.<br />
After the raindrops stop falling.<br />
Mother Mary.

And like life<br />
she once faded, memory<br />
of the midnight swans.

Mother Mary<br />
mother of Jesus holds babies.<br />
Mother Mary<br />
strewn pieces of her affection.<br />
With Buddha shall rise again.<br />
After the raindrops stop falling.<br />
Mother Mary.

And raised Jesus<br />
to befriend Buddha, and raise<br />
the world in her light.<br />
the world in her light
