The cult took place in an<br />
abandoned school.<br />
Abandoned school<br />
with all the ghouls in the yard<br />
singing along.

Inside the school were<br />
dorms, where I once<br />
stayed with no other<br />
student to come to play with<br />
in schoolyard.

Instead every Sunday<br />
was a ritual that<br />
blinded many with bits<br />
of toilet paper poking<br />
eyes out.

To leave the cult one must<br />
resist the gouging.<br />
Resist the gouging<br />
of toilet paper poking<br />
eyes out.

In the choir room I had<br />
from the alter resting<br />
in the hallway, long<br />
waiting till the end for cult<br />
to make chants.

As I left quietly from<br />
the schoolyard with<br />
my only luggage,<br />
I waited for the bus to<br />
take me away.

The pain from this culty town<br />
of gouging eyes.
