## SIFIYAPEHUMA [ Si-fi shah-peh oo-mah ]
### Lady Of The Rain And Floods

<i>Sifiyapehuma is derived from the French word "Fille De Pluie"</i>

Lady of the rain<br />
Namaksin<br />
in the dirt, carries large<br />
umbra.

She is walking in the rain,<br />
through storm and the sun<br />
trotting long.<br />
The pathless<br />
Voyage

she walks and rests long.<br />
In the dirt, carries large<br />
umbra.

Rain stops.<br />
With rosed braid<br />
skirt ripples in the wind.

In her clogs she aches with all her pain<br />
wincing.<br />
Rain starts,<br />
and finally stops.

If one could<br />
offer a<br />
home for the needy,<br />
may the<br />
drops stop.

And never return.
