Dying inside, within<br />
Inside the mind I rest<br />
Slowly under skin<br />
Inside I rot long within.<br />
Long days ahead in mind<br />
Lasting seasons.

Under a thinning roof<br />
Slowly I must go poof.<br />
Inside mind, rest<br />
On the old futon.<br />
Nocturnal moonlight for<br />
So many seasons.

For I am exhausted,<br />
In my dillussionment.
