My Alsace.<br />
It's not Paris or old Tokyo.<br />
My Alsace,<br />
with flower gardens and rivers<br />
as roads in Summer Strasbourg.<br />
Like a taste of Beer.<br />
My Alsace.

With Alsace the<br />
expectations do not<br />
diverge. It glues.

In Manga journals<br />
they say the gates, and yet<br />
In Manga journals<br />
it is work culture remains.<br />
If contests were all Japan,<br />
then what does this say of Toko.<br />
In Manga journals

Where gates shut<br />
out, the talented and the<br />
oppressed. Alsace

For me, at least<br />
is what keeps me possessed<br />
with its open gates.<br />
With Manwha coming close,<br />
tempting me with French country.

And KPop at the door.
