My grandpa worked on nukes,<br />
long enough to puke.<br />
All the waste burning,<br />
this work one can't rebuke<br />
with hot gear.

In world war II, he was<br />
sent to fight the Nazis,<br />
when his plane went down.<br />
One doctor gave him lots<br />
of hot soup.

There was no more warden,<br />
in that prison garden.<br />
Only the prison dirt.

After he worked on benches,<br />
requesting wenches<br />
in his basement dwell.<br />
After he worked on benches,<br />
went stair crazy.

With all the nukes he worked<br />
at the facility,<br />
his anxieties<br />
were growing all the Brussels<br />
one could eat.
