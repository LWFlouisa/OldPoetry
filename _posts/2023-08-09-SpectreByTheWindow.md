Midnight nocturne<br />
how it torments me in sleep.<br />
Midnight nocturne<br />
it arrives to soon when<br />
I'm not ready for shifting<br />
into the morning red sunlight.<br />
Midnight nocturne.

Here is morning<br />
becoming midnight shadows...<br />
Ghosts wander the night.

CHORUS<br />
I can't help but want to devour you<br />
from your neck down to spine.<br />
I think your curly locks are so divine.

I feel chills<br />
wander up my spiral stairwell.<br />
I feel chills,<br />
the specter with its long gaze<br />
fills me with torment and lust<br />
as my body fades to dust.<br />
I feel chills.

CHORUS<br />
I am the shadows on on the wall.<br />
The ghosts along the window glass.<br />
I think your curly locks are so divine.

Here lies humanity,<br />
knocking at the door and waiting.<br />
Yet nobody will let them in.
