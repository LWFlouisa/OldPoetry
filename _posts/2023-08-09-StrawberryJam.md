Blond Asian girlfriend.<br />
Born in Japan, raised in France.<br />
Wears skinny jeans and Birks,<br />
while she jiggles her pants.<br />
Thank god for Idol pop,<br />
who eyeball you like a lollypop.<br />
All that and Strawberry Jam.

Tap shoes serve as much to arouse<br />
As it does to inspire dance.<br />
But leaves one tired and weary.

Ms. Strawberry jam, with avacado toast.<br />
And a lopsided bow, with a mouth full of Chuck Roast.<br />
Youll never find an idol perfectly thin.<br />
To thin and wooden shoes breaks her back.<br />
To think and her chest breaks her back.<br />
Bows like lopsided ribbons, while eating a ribeye.

I like half French girl, have Japanese.<br />
That I cant deny.
