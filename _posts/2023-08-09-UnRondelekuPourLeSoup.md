My girls a bot.<br />
With gears and clocks.<br />
My girls a bot<br />
wearing clogs with no socks.<br />
Hair from head to toe<br />
she nestles her gentle neck<br />
Under moonlights embrace.<br />
My girls a bot.

The Eiffel tower<br />
looms under the moonlight.<br />
Le loup sont hauringu.

My girls a bot<br />
and her pets a wolf thats howling.<br />
My girls a bot<br />
and she hunts more scary things<br />
like shadows on Asylum walls.<br />
She waits for the sunlight to lit.<br />
My girls a bot.

With a werewolf<br />
as a pet she pup in sewer<br />
under the moonlight hour.

She wears flowers,<br />
her hair like golden sundrops.<br />
She wears flowers<br />
that bright out her small red eyes.<br />
With spurs she rides the loupus<br />
through empty asylum hallway.<br />
She wear flowers.

And hides under
The sunlight from the morning.
The daylight comes.
