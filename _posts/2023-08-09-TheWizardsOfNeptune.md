Tickets for sale, tickets for sale.<br />
Tickets to the moon, tickets from Earth.<br />
Earth will fluff up like a big balloon.<br />
And become a hot Neptune.

There was once 8,000,000,000<br />
And now there is 50,000,000,000.<br />
Split into forms of different species<br />
From normal humans,<br />
to one that subdue gravitation.

Tickets for sale, tickets for sale.<br />
Tickets to the moon, tickets from Earth.<br />
Earth will fluff up like a big balloon.<br />
And become a hot Neptune.<br />
Board the generation ships.

Perhaps one day will meet a wizard,<br />
That harnesses the energy,<br />
From the old one,<br />
turned into a hot Neptune.<br />
To feed all the subspecies,<br />
of humans and cyberetics.
