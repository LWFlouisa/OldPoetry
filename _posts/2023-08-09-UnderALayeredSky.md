In the sky in domed cities / with polluted clouds all day<br />
the rain comes down / where we went swimming.<br />
For all that came down / when we swam around<br />
the air was putrid with decay / with polluted clouds all day.<br />
To think that life died / all around wires.

And yet above the sky we / longed to see another<br />
day, for each other / for all each other.<br />
Yet down below where / the devil keeps his crib<br />
with some other way to be / like there are other.<br />
Yet under sky / the blood drips.

In the sky in domed cities / with polluted clouds all day<br />
the rain comes down / where we went swimming.<br />
For all that came down / when we swam around<br />
the air was putrid with decay / with polluted clouds all day.<br />
To think that life died / all around wires.

Under the wires / I seek the meshing<br />
Beneath a layered sky.
