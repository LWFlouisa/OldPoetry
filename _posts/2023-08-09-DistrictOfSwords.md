For the anthem that<br />
decorates the room<br />
In blue and red,<br />
A petite brunnette<br />
Loses her very head.

In other districts<br />
Where one shall die,<br />
They hang or fry<br />
In that dimly lit district<br />
That one may live to try.

For Marxist dreams<br />
The old reality screams<br />
Wanting katharsis.<br />
Reality anguishes,<br />
Love now languishes.

For unlike my<br />
Dreams of love afar<br />
Across the sea<br />
Reality not free<br />
Wants one not to bleed.

For the anthem that<br />
decorates the room<br />
In blue and red,<br />
A petite brunnette<br />
Loses her very head.

Whether its gallows<br />
Or a Soviet cartridge<br />
Across the winter hallows,<br />
Or a guillotine.<br />
Or a guillotine.

One can only dream,
Of a better world,
where one shall not bleed.
