## Ehena Of Broken Promises
In the farmyard<br />
where the angels sing chanson,<br />
she resides<br />
as a shadow, unwoken dream<br />
at night where angels scream<br />
of broken promises, midnight<br />
    Comes closing.<br />
In the farmyard.

It was a time<br />
long ago, when fire had sticks<br />
to light the fire.<br />
With this wine she worships<br />
this unholy sacrament.

In the farmyard<br />
where the angels sing chanson,<br />
she resides<br />
as a shadow, unwoken dream<br />
at night where angels scream<br />
of broken promises, midnight<br />
    Comes closing.<br />
In the farmyard.

And some angels she<br />
stabs so cleanly with gusto.<br />
The angel's knifeblood.

And from this farmyard,<br />
To the Strasbourg she waited<br />
for dropping blade.<br />
But it was not this death<br />
that bid her adieu.

But the asylum, where the bedtime<br />
with rope swinging, bid her goodnight.
