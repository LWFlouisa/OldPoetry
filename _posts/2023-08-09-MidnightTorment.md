The cherry blossom<br />
pink as a bossom<br />
blooms.<br />
It blooms so bright,<br />
winter falls soon.v
Tonight<br />
the shadows along<br />
the hamlet gate<br />
creaks.

Along a winter<br />
snowy wasteland so cold<br />
the land is empty.

Except the shadows calling,<br />
calling for my presence.

At first I thought<br />
that I was saw things<br />
lurking.<br />
To think that the mind<br />
conjures fancy<br />
terrors.<br />
At night the dead<br />
Wander graveyard<br />
Shambling.

Along a winter<br />
snowy wasteland so cold<br />
the land is empty.

Except the shadows calling,<br />
calling for my presence.

Only the sun is<br />
My relief my<br />
torment.
